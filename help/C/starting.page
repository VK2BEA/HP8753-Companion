    <desc>Using HP8753 Companion for the first time</desc>
  </info>
  
  <title>GPIB connection to the HP8753</title>

  <p>The first and most important setup task is to establish communication with the HP8753 Network analyzer over the HPIB (GPIB).</p>
  <p>Connection to the HP8753 may be made using a GPIB controller attached to the computer or using a USBTMC/USB488 class GPIB device.</p>
  <p >When you start <app>Gutenberg</app> for the first time, there will be no saved calibration &amp; setup profiles nor will there be any saved traces.</p>
  <p>A necessary prerequisite for for the program to communicate with the HP8753 is the installation of the Linux GPIB driver and libraries.</p>
  <p>For details on installing the Linux GPIB driver refer to the site, <link href="https://linux-gpib.sourceforge.io/">https://linux-gpib.sourceforge.io/</link> 
  or to install RPMs on a Fedora distribution, see <link href="https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/vk2bea/GPIB/">https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/vk2bea/GPIB/</link></p>

  <title>Establishing a GPIB connection to HP8753</title>
      <p>Select the GPIB page.</p>
  <p>Select the type of interface to be used by activating either the GPIB or USBTMC radio buttons. If you select USBTMC, the only active configurable option will be the <em>Minor Device No.</em>. Set this to the minor device number for the USBTMC device connected to the HP8753 GPIB port. Ensure that the device (e.g. <code>/dev/usbtmc0</code>) has read and write permissions for the user.</p>
  <p>If the GPIB interface is selected use the following steps:</p>
  <steps>
    <item><p>Select the GPIB interface using the radio button</p></item>
    <item><p>Check the <em>'Use Minor Dev No. &amp; PID'</em> box to explicitly use the controller card index and GPIB PID, or leave unchecked to refer to the device and controller by a name defined in the <code>/etc/gpib.conf</code> file. </p>
    <code mime="application/xml"><![CDATA[device {
        minor    = 0            /* minor number for interface board this device is connected to */
        name     = "hp8753c"    /* device mnemonic          */
        pad      = 16           /* The Primary Address      */
        sad      = 0            /* Secondary Address        */

        eos      = 0xa          /* EOS Byte                 */
        set-reos = no           /* Terminate read if EOS    */
        set-bin  = no           /* Compare EOS 8-bit        */
        timeout  = T30s         /* timeout for commands     */
    }]]></code>
    </item>
    <item><p>Set the HP8753 name used in the GPIB configuration file (<code>/etc/gpib.conf</code> or <code>/usr/local/etc/gpib.conf</code>), or set the minor device number and GPIB PID</p></item>
    <item><p>Observe the status line to ensure that communications has been established</p></item>

  <title>Interrogate the HP8753 Learn String</title>
  <p>Some data on the state of the HP8753 is not obtainable using the documented HPIB commands; however, these data are present embedded in the <em>Learn String</em>. The format of the <em>Learn String</em> differs between firmware versions so it is necessary to perform some probing of the netwok analyzer and examination the altered <em>Learn String</em> in order to identifi>y where the missing information is be found.</p>
  <steps>
   <item><p>Select the <em>Options</em> page</p></item>
   <item><p>Press the <key>Analyze Learn String</key> to commence probing.</p><p>Settings on the HP8753 are altered using HPIB commands and the <em>Learn String</em> otained and compared to a baseline.</p></item>
  </steps>
  <note style="important"><p>This is a one-time process. The information on the <em>Learn String</em> (for the version of the firmware obtained from the HP8753) and the GPIB settings are saved and restored upon program start.</p></note>
