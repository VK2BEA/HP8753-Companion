  <p>There are several options available to alter the display of traces</p>
  <section id="interploation">
     <title>Bezier polar &amp; Smith spline</title>
    <p>The HP8753 linearly interpolates between sample points. This is may be appropriate with cartesian plots; however, it produces less convining results on polar and Smith plots. </p>
    <p>The user has the ability to select Bezier interolation for polar and Smith plots. This will draw a Bezier curve between points that more smoothely renders these plots 
       <em>(the second derivative of the curve is zero at the sample points)</em></p>
    <p>The composite Bezier curve exactly goes through all samples, it is only the interpolated points between samples that differ from the linearly interpolated plot.</p>
    <note style="information"><p>Since the markers are sampled on the HP8753 using linear interpolation, the Bezier interpolated curves may not necessarily exactly go through the marker points.</p></note>
  </section>
  <section id="date+time">
    <title>Show Date &amp; Time on plot</title>
    <p>Display the date and time that the trace was captured on the plot.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="admitance">
    <title>Admitance / Susceptance Smith grid</title>
    <p>Show the admitance and susceptance grid or the impeadance and reactance grids on Smith plots.</p>
    <p>This also changes the display for live markers.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="delta">
    <title>Delta marker actual values</title>
    <p>When using delta markers, the HP8753 displays the stimulus and response values of the selected reference marker as zero.</p>
    <p>This option is available to display the absolute value of the reference marker stimulus and response values.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="HPGL">
    <title>Do not retrieve HPGL screen plot</title>
    <p>By default, both the trace data and an HPGL plot of the screen contents are retrieved from the HP8753 when the <key>Get Trace</key> button is pressed.</p>
    <p>If the HPGL plot is not needed, selecting this option will instruct the application not to request the HPGL screen plot. This will reduce the data transfer time as there is less traffic on the GPIB; however, the HPGL plot of the screen will not be avaiable for display and will not be saved with the trace.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="HP_Logo">
    <title>Show HP logo on plot</title>
    <p>Display the HP logo at the top of the plot, as is done on the network analyzer display.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="Analyze">
    <title>Analyze Learn String</title>
    <p>The <em>HP8753 Companion</em> uses the GPIB commands defined by in the 8753 documentation to determine the state of the instrument.</p>
    <p>In some cases, additional information is required wich can be obtained from the instrument's <em>Learn String</em>. The format of the <em>Learn String</em>
       varies with instument model and firmware. A software routine attempts to analyze the learn string to determine where the required data is located.</p>
       <p>This procedure is only required to be performed once (unless another variant of the 8753 is used)</p>
